Favorites for Twitter
================
Favorites for Twitter is a Chrome extension that brings the old favorite button back to Twitter. If you use Twitter, you might have noticed that Twitter switched out the star icon for a heart. Most people would be completely fine with this, but some decided Twitter had simply gone too far this time.

Are you tired of being told whether you 'like' or 'favorite' something? Are you tired of Twitter telling you how to live your life? Well good news for you - you can get the star button back.

You're welcome.ï»¿ Favorites for Twitter is licensed under the GPL v3 license.
